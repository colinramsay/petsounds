PetSounds is a testbed for a replacement for Headphones (https://github.com/rembo10/headphones). It's written in Go (http://golang.org) and is designed to be deployed on a Raspberry Pi.

At the moment it is *NOTHING* like Headphones. Still todo at the very least:

- Lots of UI work
- Local storage of artists & releases
- Preferences screens
